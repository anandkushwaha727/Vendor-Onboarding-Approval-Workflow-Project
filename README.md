# Vendor-Onboarding-Approval-Workflow-Project
This project is designed to demonstrate a realistic, enterprise-grade SAP RAP business object, not a demo or tutorial-level implementation. The goal is to model how vendors are onboarded, validated, submitted, approved, and finally activated in a controlled, auditable, and SAP-standard manner.
